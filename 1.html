<h2>coffee bean</h2>
<p><img src="gb.jpg" width="450"><br>
    A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee.
    It is the pit inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a cherry.
    Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called
    stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans,
    they are referred to as such because of their resemblance to true beans.
    The fruits; cherries or berries, most commonly contain two stones with
    their flat sides together. A small percentage of cherries contain a
    single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a "peaberry".
    The peaberry occurs only between 10% and 15% of the time,
    and it is a fairly common (yet scientifically unproven) belief that
    they have more flavour than normal coffee beans.[3] Like Brazil nuts
    (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm.[4]
