  Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical
  properties of green coffee beans into roasted coffee
  products. The roasting process is what produces the
  characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green
   coffee beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain
   similar if not higher levels of acids, protein, sugars,
   and caffeine as those that have been roasted, but lack the
   taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard and other
    chemical reactions that occur during roasting.
