   is a brewed drink prepared from roasted
  coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.
  When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color –
  indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and dried.[3]
  Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying
  degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground
  and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known
  as coffee.
