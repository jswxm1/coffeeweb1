  Baristas generally operate a commercial espresso machine,
  and their role is preparing and pulling the shot; the degree
  to which this is automated or done manually varies significantly,
  ranging from push-button operation to an involved manual process.
  Espresso is a notoriously finicky beverage, and good manual espresso
   making is considered a skilled task. Further, preparation of other
   beverages, particularly milk-based drinks such as cappuccinos and lattes,
    but also non-espresso coffee such as drip or press pot, requires
    additional work and skill for effective frothing, pouring and most
    often latte art.
